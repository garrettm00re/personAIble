AI: Hey Jimmy, let's get started with your daily roundup. How was your day? Give me as much or as little detail as you're comfortable with. 
User: I had a great time. I was with good friends all day, made jokes, ate well, and enjoyed the world around us. It was rejuvenating in many ways. I'd hoped to get more work done, but frankly I'm glad I didn't. Time with friends is fleeting.
AI: Please provide a detailed account of what you've done today.

WAKEUP  11:10am
Eat light breakfast, shower, etc.   30 minutes
Went to Starbucks at the top of Mulholland where we ate breakfast and whatnot.  30 minutes
Afterwards, we drove to Giacomo's office building and did a quick tour. 40 minutes
We walked a short distance to Century City mall.    10 minutes
They all went in to the Lego store while I explored the mall a bit. 30 minutes
Following this excursion, we went to Zankou Chicken. The first one was closed due to a power outage so we took a trip down the 405 to another location. 20 minutes
Then, we ate and met up with our friend Evan whom I hadn't seen in a long time. It was great to see him.    45 minutes
Following our nice Mediterranean lunch, we went to the Getty Museum. We spent awhile walking around the green grounds, admiring the gardens and the view of the city. The art inside was predominantly modern and contemporary art. It gave us a chance to talk and expore something new. We made jokes and walked some more before heading out to admire the sunset.   2 hours
All of us went back to Giacomo's house (he's hosting us this weekend) and I got to work.    45 minutes
Giacomo, Evan, and I relaxed for a bit (~ 45 minutes) before Cameron and Nolan came back. Evan left around 9:30pm.  45 minutes
The rest of us went out to grab Pizza and tried to play pool afterwards but the queue was too long. 1 hour
We ended up just hanging out at the house, playing ping pong and foosball for a few hours. It was a lot of fun. 3 hours
We talked for awhile then went to bed.  30 minutes
BED 2:00am

AI: Just to be clear, you didn't complete any todo items?
User: Correct.
What could have gone better?
I could have gotten a better night's rest the night before. I should have embraced the limited opportunity to spend time with my friends and nixed the idea of working. I wasn't realistic with my goal to work four hours.

Did you encounter any new todo items today? 
Description, Importance, Urgency, Expected Time to Complete
Make instagram content for the next week, 6, 1/6/2025 @ 10:00pm, 2 hours

What events do you have going on tomorrow? (google calendar integration would be VERY nice)
    I have to wake up at 8:00am.
    I will probably go to the gym for two hours around 5:30pm.
    I will promptly eat dinner with my parents after that (around 7:30pm).
