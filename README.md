# personAIble

The goal of this project is to provide a more personable user experience. 

The key idea is creating a user model, modifying if during application usage, and using it for context and user insights.

The app currently works for a test user "Charles River". "Who?" "Where To?" and "How?" are portions of Charles River's user model.

I am in the process of enabling unique users (via Google's OAuth2), implementing onboarding, and cleaning up the codebase.

Core technologies:
Flask, Python, GPT4o, LlangChain, Vercel
